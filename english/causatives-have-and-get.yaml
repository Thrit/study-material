Causatives - Have and Get:

  Definition:
    - Causative verbs are used when we want to talk about something that someone else did for us or for another person.
    - Subject caused the action to happen.
    - Similar to using a passive.
    - The focus is not on who did the action.

    Have + object + past participle (have something done):
      - Usually when we're talking about paying someone to do something for us.

      e.g:
        - I had my car washed.
        - John will have his house painted.

    Get + object + past participle (get something done):
