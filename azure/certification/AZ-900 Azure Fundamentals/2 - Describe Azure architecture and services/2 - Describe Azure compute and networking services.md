# Describe Azure Compute and Networking Services

## [Unit 1: Learning Objectives](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-azure-compute-networking-services/1-introduction)
After completing this module, youâ€™ll be able to:
- Compare compute types, including container instances, virtual machines, and functions.
- Describe virtual machine options, including virtual machines (VMs), virtual machine scale sets, virtual machine availability sets, and Azure Virtual Desktop.
- Describe resources required for virtual machines.
- Describe application hosting options, including Azure Web Apps, containers, and virtual machines.
- Describe virtual networking, including the purpose of Azure Virtual Networks, Azure virtual subnets, peering, Azure DNS, VPN Gateway, and ExpressRoute.
- Define public and private endpoints.

## [Unit 2: Describe Azure Virtual Machines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-azure-compute-networking-services/2-virtual-machines)
- Virtual Machines (VMs) provide infrastructure as a service (IaaS) in the form of a virtualized server.
- Ideal for scenarios requiring total control over the operating system, custom software, or custom hosting configurations.

## [Unit 6: Describe Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-azure-compute-networking-services/6-functions)
- Azure Functions can be stateless or stateful (Durable Functions), allowing for event-driven serverless computing.

## [Unit 8: Describe Azure Virtual Networking](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-azure-compute-networking-services/8-virtual-network)
- Azure Virtual Networks provide capabilities for isolation, segmentation, internet communication, on-premises connectivity, traffic routing, and filtering.
- Communication between Azure resources can be achieved through virtual networks and service endpoints.
- On-premises connectivity options include point-to-site VPN, site-to-site VPN, and Azure ExpressRoute.
- Route tables and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) are used for traffic routing.
- Network security groups and network virtual appliances help filter network traffic.
- Virtual networks can be connected using network peering and user-defined routes.

## [Unit 11: Describe Azure ExpressRoute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-azure-compute-networking-services/11-expressroute)
- Azure ExpressRoute extends on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection, offering benefits like global connectivity, dynamic routing, and built-in redundancy.
- Connectivity to Microsoft cloud services includes Office 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure services.
- ExpressRoute connectivity models include co-location at a cloud exchange, point-to-point Ethernet connection, any-to-any networks, and direct connectivity from ExpressRoute sites.

## [Unit 12: Describe Azure Domain Name System (DNS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-azure-compute-networking-services/12-domain-name-system)
- Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains, offering reliability, security, ease of use, customizable virtual networks, and alias records.
- It provides reliability and performance through Azure's global network of DNS name servers and anycast networking.
- Security features include Azure RBAC, activity logs, and resource locking.
- Ease of use is facilitated by integration with the Azure portal.
- Customizable virtual networks support private DNS domains.
- Alias records allow referencing Azure resources like public IP addresses or Traffic Manager Profiles.
