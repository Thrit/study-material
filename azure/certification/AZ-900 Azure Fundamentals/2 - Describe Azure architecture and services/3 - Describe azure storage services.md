- Benefits of Azure Storage include durability, security, scalability, managed services, and accessibility.
- Azure Blobs offer storage for massive unstructured data, with tiers including Hot, Cool, Cold, and Archive.
- Azure Files provide shared access to files via SMB or NFS.
- Azure Queues store large numbers of messages.
- Azure Disks work like physical disks.
- Azure Tables store structured, non-relational data.
