### Learning Objectives:
- Describe directory services in Azure, including Azure Active Directory (AD) and Azure AD DS.

## [Unit 2: Azure Directory Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-azure-identity-access-security/2-directory-services)
- **Microsoft Enterprise ID (Entra ID):** Enables sign-in and access to Microsoft cloud apps and services.
- **Features:** Authentication, Single sign-on (SSO), Application management, Device management.
- **Integration:** Establish connection with on-premises AD using Microsoft Entra Connect.
- **Microsoft Enterprise Domain Services:** Manage domain services like domain join, group policy, LDAP, Kerberos/NTLM authentication.

## [Unit 3: Azure Authentication Methods](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-azure-identity-access-security/3-authentication-methods)
- **Authentication:** Establishing identity for users, services, or devices.
- **Methods:** Single sign-on (SSO), Multifactor authentication (MFA), Passwordless authentication.
- **Examples:** Windows Hello for Business, Microsoft Authenticator App, FIDO2 security keys.

## [Unit 4: Azure External Identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-azure-identity-access-security/4-external-identities)
- **Interactions:** Business to business (B2B) collaboration, B2B direct connect, Business to customer (B2C) scenarios.

## [Unit 5: Azure Conditional Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-azure-identity-access-security/5-conditional-access)
- **Purpose:** Control access to resources based on identity signals.
- **Scenarios:** Require MFA, Allow access only from managed devices, Block access from untrusted sources.

## [Unit 6: Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-azure-identity-access-security/6-role-based-access-control)
- **Principle:** Least privilege access.
- **Scope:** Management group, Subscription, Resource group, Resource.

- **Principles:** Verify explicitly, Use least privilege access, Assume breach.

## [Unit 8: Defense-in-Depth](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-azure-identity-access-security/8-describe-defense-depth)
- **Layers:** Physical security, Identity and access, Perimeter, Network, Compute, Application, Data.

## [Unit 9: Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-azure-identity-access-security/9-describe-microsoft-defender-for-cloud)
- **Purpose:** Monitor security posture, Assess vulnerabilities, Secure resources, Defend against threats.
