## [Unit 1: Learning Objectives](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-cloud-service-types/1-introduction)
After completing this module, youâ€™ll be able to:
- Describe infrastructure as a service (IaaS).
- Describe platform as a service (PaaS).
- Describe software as a service (SaaS).
- Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud service (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).

## IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service
### Costs:
- No upfront costs.
- Users pay only for what they consume.

### User Responsibility:
- Purchase, installation, configuration, and management of their own software, operating systems, middleware, and applications.

### Cloud Provider Responsibility:
- Ensures that the underlying cloud infrastructure (such as virtual machines, virtualization, storage, and networking) is available for the user.

### Examples:
- Azure Virtual Machines

## PaaS: Platform as a Service
### Costs:
- No upfront costs.
- Users pay only for what they consume.

### User Responsibility:
- Custom development of their own applications.
- Focus on the application or workload they want to run.
- Not responsible for managing the underlying server or infrastructure.

### Cloud Provider Responsibility:
- Operating system management, network, and service configuration.
- Typically responsible for everything apart from the application that a user wants to run.
- Provides the user a complete managed platform on which to run the application.

### Examples:
- Azure Storage, Azure SQL Databases, Azure App Service

## SaaS: Software as a Service
### Costs:
- No upfront costs.
- Users pay a subscription, typically on a monthly or annual basis.

### User Responsibility:
- Users just use the application software.
- Not responsible for any maintenance or management of the underlying software.

### Cloud Provider Responsibility:
- Provision, management, and maintenance of the application software.

### Examples:
- Office 365, Skype, Dynamic CRM Online
