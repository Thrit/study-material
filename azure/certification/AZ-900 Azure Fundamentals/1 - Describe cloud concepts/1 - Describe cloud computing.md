# Describe Cloud Computing

## [Unit 1: Learning Objectives](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-cloud-compute/1-introduction-microsoft-azure-fundamentals)
After completing this module, you’ll be able to:
- Define cloud computing.
- Describe the shared responsibility model.
- Define cloud models, including public, private, and hybrid.
- Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud model.
- Describe the consumption-based model.
- Compare cloud pricing models.

## [Unit 3: What is Cloud Computing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-cloud-compute/3-what-cloud-compute)
Cloud Computing are services offered over the internet which means they are not physically with you.
- Common services:
  - Virtual Machines;
  - Internet of Things (IoT);
  - Machine Learning.

## [Unit 4: Describe the Shared Responsibility Model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-cloud-compute/4-describe-shared-responsibility-model)
Shared responsibility is a model that's been shared between the cloud provider and the consumer.
- Cloud Provider's responsibility:
  - Physical security;
  - Power;
  - Cooling;
  - Network Connectivity.
- Consumer's responsibility:
  - Data;
  - Access security;
  - Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud.

## [Unit 5: Define Cloud Models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-cloud-compute/5-define-cloud-models)
### Public Cloud
- No capital expenditures to scale up
- Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned
- Organizations pay only for what they use
- Organizations don’t have complete control over resources and security

### Private Cloud
- Organizations have complete control over resources and security
- Data is not collocated with other organizations’ data
- Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance
- Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates

### Hybrid Cloud
- Provides the most flexibility
- Organizations determine where to run their applications
- Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements
- Azure Arc is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment.
- Azure VMware Solution helps migrate a VMware in a private cloud environment to a public or hybrid cloud.

## [Unit 6: Describe the Consumption-Based Model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-cloud-compute/6-describe-consumption-based-model)
- Two types of expenses to consider: Capital expenditure (CapEx) and Operational expenditure (OpEx).
- CapEx is typically a one-time purchase like buying a company vehicle or building a datacenter.
- OpEx is spending money on services or products over time like renting a convention center or vehicle also the cloud services.
