# Describe the Benefits of Using Cloud Services

## [Unit 1: Learning Objectives](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-benefits-use-cloud-services/1-introduction)
After completing this module, youâ€™ll be able to:
- Describe the benefits of high availability and scalability in the cloud.
- Describe the benefits of reliability and predictability in the cloud.
- Describe the benefits of security and governance in the cloud.
- Describe the benefits of manageability in the cloud.

## [Unit 2: Describe the Benefits of High Availability and Scalability in the Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-benefits-use-cloud-services/2-high-availability-scalability-cloud)
### High Availability
- High availability focuses on ensuring maximum availability, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur.
- Azure is a highly available cloud environment with uptime guarantees depending on the service.

### Scalability
- Scalability refers to the ability to adjust resources to meet demand.
  - **Vertical Scaling:** Add more processing power by increasing CPU or RAM.
  - **Horizontal Scaling:** Add or remove resources dynamically based on demand.

## [Unit 3: Describe the Benefits of Reliability and Predictability in the Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-benefits-use-cloud-services/3-reliability-predictability-cloud)
### Reliability
- Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function.

### Predictability
- Predictability ensures confidence in moving forward.
  - **Performance Predictability:** Predicting resources needed for a positive user experience.
  - **Cost Predictability:** Forecasting cloud spending.

## [Unit 5: Describe the Benefits of Manageability in the Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-benefits-use-cloud-services/5-manageability-cloud)
### Manageability
- There are two types: Management of the cloud and Management in the cloud.
#### Management of the Cloud
- Automate resource scaling, deployment, monitoring, and health checks.
#### Management in the Cloud
- Manage cloud environment and resources through web portals, command line interfaces, APIs, and PowerShell.
