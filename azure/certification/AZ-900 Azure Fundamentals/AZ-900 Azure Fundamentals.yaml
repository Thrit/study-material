Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: Describe cloud concepts

1. Describe cloud computing
    Unit 1: Learning objectives
        After completing this module, you’ll be able to:

        - Define cloud computing.
        - Describe the shared responsibility model.
        - Define cloud models, including public, private, and hybrid.
        - Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud model.
        - Describe the consumption-based model.
        - Compare cloud pricing models.


    Unit 3: What is cloud computing
        Cloud Computing are services offered over the internet which means they are not physically with you.
            Common services:
                - Virtual Machines;
                - Internet of Things (IoT);
                - Machine Learning.


    Unit 4: Describe the shared responsibility model
        Shared responsibility is a model that's been shared between the cloud provider and the consumer.
            Cloud Provider's responsibility:
                - Physical security;
                - Power;
                - Cooling;
                - Network Connectivity.

            Consumer's responsibility:
                - Data;
                - Access security (You only give access for those who need it.);
                - Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (Cell phones, computers, and so on).

            Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:
                - Operating systems;
                - Network controls;
                - Applications;
                - Identity and infrastructure.


    Unit 5: Define cloud models
        Public cloud
            - No capital expenditures to scale up
            - Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned
            - Organizations pay only for what they use
            - Organizations don’t have complete control over resources and security

        Private cloud
            - Organizations have complete control over resources and security
            - Data is not collocated with other organizations’ data
            - Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance
            - Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates

        Hybrid cloud
            - Provides the most flexibility
            - Organizations determine where to run their applications
            - Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements

        Azure Arc is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment.
        Azure VMware Solution helps to migrate a VMware in a private cloud environment to a public or hybred cloud.


    Unit 6: Describe the consumption-based model
        - Two types of expenses to consider: Capital expenditure (CapEx) and Operational expenditure (OpEx).
        - CapEx is typically a one-time purchase like buying a company vehicle or building a datacenter.
        - OpEx is spending money on services or products over time like renting a convetion center or vehicle also the cloud services.


2. Describe the benefits of using cloud services
    Unit 1: Learning objectives
        After completing this module, you’ll be able to:

        - Describe the benefits of high availability and scalability in the cloud.
        - Describe the benefits of reliability and predictability in the cloud.
        - Describe the benefits of security and governance in the cloud.
        - Describe the benefits of manageability in the cloud.

    Unit 2: Describe the benefits of high availability and scalability in the cloud
        High Availability
            High availability focuses on ensuring maximum availability, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur.
            Azure is a highly available cloud environment with uptime guarantees depending on the service. These guarantees are part of the service-level agreements (SLAs).


        Scalability
            Scalability refers to the ability to adjust resources to meet demand.

            Vertical scaling
                - You need more processing power, you could vertically scale up to add more CPUs or RAM to the virtual machine or scale down.
            
            Horizontal scaling
                - You suddenly experienced a steep jump in demand, your deployed resources could be scaled out (either automatically or manually). 
                For example, you could add additional virtual machines or containers, scaling out. In the same manner, if there was a significant drop in demand, 
                deployed resources could be scaled in (either automatically or manually), scaling in.

    Unit 3: Describe the benefits of reliability and predictability in the cloud
        Reliability
            - Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. 


        Predictability
            - Predictability in the cloud lets you move forward with confidence. Predictability can be focused on performance predictability or cost predictability.

            Performance
                - Performance predictability focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive experience for your customers. 
                Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability are just some of the cloud concepts that support performance predictability.

            Cost
                - Cost predictability is focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend

    Unit 5: Describe the benefits of manageability in the cloud
        Manageability
            There are two types: Management of the cloud and Management in the cloud

            Management of the cloud
                Management of the cloud speaks to managing your cloud resources. In the cloud, you can:

                    - Automatically scale resource deployment based on need.
                    - Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template, removing the need for manual configuration.
                    - Monitor the health of resources and automatically replace failing resources.
                    - Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics, so you’re aware of performance in real time.

            Management in the cloud
                Management in the cloud speaks to how you’re able to manage your cloud environment and resources. You can manage these:

                    - Through a web portal.
                    - Using a command line interface.
                    - Using APIs.
                    - Using PowerShell.


3. Describe cloud service types
    Unit 1: Learning objectives
        After completing this module, you’ll be able to:

            - Describe infrastructure as a service (IaaS).
            - Describe platform as a service (PaaS).
            - Describe software as a service (SaaS).
            - Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud service (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).


    IaaS: Cloud provider responsibility
    PaaS: Responsibility shared between the cloud provider and consumer
    SaaS: Cosumer responsibility

    IaaS
        Costs:
            - No upfront costs.
            - Users pay only for what they consume.

        User responsibility:
            - Purchase, installation , configuration, and management of their own software,
            operating systems, middleware, and applications

        Cloud Provider Responsibility:
            - Ensures that the underlying cloud infrastructure (such as virtual machines, virtualization,
            storage, and networking) is available for the user.

        Examples:
            - Azure Virtual Machines

    
    PaaS
        Costs:
            - No upfront costs.

        User responsibility:
            - Custom development of their own applications.
            - Allows the user to focus on the application or workload they want to run.
            - Not responsible for managing the underlying server or infrastructure.

        Cloud Provider Responsibility:
            - Operating system management, network, and service configuration.
            - Typically responsible for everything apart from the application that a user wants to run.
            - Provide the user a complete managed platform on which to run the application.

        Examples:
            - Azure Storage, Azure SQL Databases, Azure App Service

    
    SaaS
        Costs:
            - No upfront costs
            - Users pay a subscription, typically on a monthly or annual basis.
        
        User Responsibility:
            - Users just use the application software.
            - Not responsible for any maintenance or management of the underlying software.

        Cloud Provider Responsibility:
            - Provision, management, and maintenance of the application software.

        Examples:
            - Office 365, Skype, and Dynamic CRM Online


Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: Describe Azure architecture and services

1. Describe the core architectural components of Azure
    Unit 1: Learning objectives
        After completing this module, you’ll be able to:

            - Describe Azure regions, region pairs, and sovereign regions.
            - Describe Availability Zones.
            - Describe Azure datacenters.
            - Describe Azure resources and Resource Groups.
            - Describe subscriptions.
            - Describe management groups.
            - Describe the hierarchy of resource groups, subscriptions, and management groups.


    Unit 5: Describe Azure physical infrastructure

        Physical infrastructure
            - Same as a large corporate datacenter.

        Regions
            - A region is a geographical area on the planet that contains at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters 
            that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network.

        Availability Zones
            - Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region.
            - An availability zone is set up to be an isolation boundary. If one zone goes down, the other continues working.

        Azure services that support availability zones fall into three categories:
            Zonal services: You pin the resource to a specific zone (for example, VMs, managed disks, IP addresses).
            Zone-redundant services: The platform replicates automatically across zones (for example, zone-redundant storage, SQL Database).
            Non-regional services: Services are always available from Azure geographies and are resilient to zone-wide outages as well as region-wide outages.

        Region pairs
            - Most Azure regions are paired with another region within the same geography
            - Reduce the chances of interruptions for any catastrophe or event related

        Sovereign Regions
            - They are instances isolated from the main instance of Azure. Tipically used for compliance or legal purposes.

    Unit 6: Describe Azure management infrastructure

        Azure subscriptions
            Subscriptions are a unit of management, billing, and scale.
            There are two types of subscription boundaries that you can use:
                - Billing boundary: This subscription type determines how an Azure account is billed for using Azure. It generates separate billing reports and 
                invoices for each subscription so that you can organize and manage costs.
                - Access control boundary: Azure applies access-management policies at the subscription level, and you can create separate subscriptions 
                to reflect different organizational structures. This billing model allows you to manage and control access to the resources that users provision 
                with specific subscriptions.

        Create additional Azure subscriptions
            Similar to using resource groups to separate resources by function or access.
                - Environments
                - Organizational structures
                - Billing


2. Describe Azure compute and networking services
    Unit 1: Learning objectives
        After completing this module, you’ll be able to:

            - Compare compute types, including container instances, virtual machines, and functions.
            - Describe virtual machine options, including virtual machines (VMs), virtual machine scale sets, virtual machine availability sets, and Azure Virtual Desktop.
            - Describe resources required for virtual machines.
            - Describe application hosting options, including Azure Web Apps, containers, and virtual machines.
            - Describe virtual networking, including the purpose of Azure Virtual Networks, Azure virtual subnets, peering, Azure DNS, VPN Gateway, and ExpressRoute.
            - Define public and private endpoints.

    Unit 2: Describe Azure Virtual Machines
        - VMs provide infrastructure as a service (IaaS) in the form of a virtualized server
        
        VMs are an ideal choice when you need:
            - Total control over the operating system (OS).
            - The ability to run custom software.
            - To use custom hosting configurations.


    Unit 6: Describe Azure functions
        Benefits of Azure Functions
            - Functions can be either stateless or stateful. When they're stateless (the default), they behave as if they're restarted 
            every time they respond to an event. When they're stateful (called Durable Functions), a context is passed through the function 
            to track prior activity.

    Unit 8: Describe Azure virtual networking
        Azure virtual networks provide the following key networking capabilities:
            - Isolation and segmentation
            - Internet communications
            - Communicate between Azure resources
            - Communicate with on-premises resources
            - Route network traffic
            - Filter network traffic
            - Connect virtual networks

        Isolation and segmentation
            - Azure virtual network allows you to create multiple isolated virtual networks. When you set up a virtual network, 
            you define a private IP address space by using either public or private IP address ranges. The IP range only exists 
            within the virtual network and isn't internet routable. You can divide that IP address space into subnets and allocate 
            part of the defined address space to each named subnet.

        Communicate between Azure resources:
            - 2 ways to do it:
                - Virtual Networks
                - Service Endpoints

        Communicate with on-premises resources
            - 3 mechanisms to create the connectivity
                - Point-to-site virtual private network: Connection used to connect computers outside the organization to the corporate
                network.
                - Site-to-site virtual private network: Link the on-premises VPN device or gateway to the Azure VPN gateway in a virtual network.
                - Azure ExpressRoute: Provide a dedicated private connectivity to Azure that doesn't travel over the internet

        Route Network Traffic
            - Route tables define the rules about how traffic should be directed
            - Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Propagate on-premises BGP routes to Azure virtual networks

        Filter Network Traffic
            - Network security groups: Azure resources that contain multiple inbound and outbound security rules. 
            - Network virtual appliances: They are specialized VMs that carry out a particular network function

        Connect virtual networks
            - Network peering: Allows to connect two virtual networks between each othe. The network is private, travels on the MS backbone
            network, which never enters in the public network.
            User-defined routes (UDR): allow you to control the routing tables between subnets within a virtual network or between virtual networks.

    Unit 11: Describe Azure ExpressRoute
        - Extend on-premises networks into the MS cloud over a private connection. Exclude public network.

        Beneftis:
            - Connectivity to Microsoft cloud services across all regions in the geopolitical region.
            - Global connectivity to Microsoft services across all regions with the ExpressRoute Global Reach.
            - Dynamic routing between your network and Microsoft via Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
            - Built-in redundancy in every peering location for higher reliability.
        
        Connectivity to MS cloud services
            - MS Office 365
            - MS Dynamics 365
            - Azure compute services, like Azure VM
            - Azure cloud services, like Azure Cosmos DB

        Global Connectivity
            - ExpressRoute Global Reach allows you to exchange data from any part of the world. Office in Asia communicating with a data center in Europe.

        Dynamic Routing
            - Usage of BGP.
            - BGP allows to exchange data between on-premises and services in Azure.

        Built-in redundancy
            - Each connectivity uses redudant devices becoming highly available.

        ExpressRoute connectivity models
            - Support 4 models to connect on-premises network to MS cloud
                - CloudExchange colocation
                - Point-to-point Ethernet connection
                - Any-to-any connection
                - Directly from ExpressRoute sites

        Co-location at a cloud exchange
            - It refers to datacenters, offices or other facilities being physically co-located at a cloud exchange.

        Point-to-point Ethernet connection
            - Use a point-to-point connection to connect a facility to the MS cloud.

        Any-to-any networks
            - Integrate a wide are network (WAN) with Azure.

        Directly from ExpressRoute sites
            - Connect directly into MS's global network at a peering location distributed across the world.

    Unit 12: Describe Azure Domain Name System (DNS)
        Hosting service for DNS domains.

        Benefits of Azure DNS
            - Reliability and performance
            - Security
            - Ease of Use
            - Customizable virtual networks
            - Alias records

        Reliability and performance
            - Azure DNS hosts domains on Azure's global network of DNS name servers, which provide resiliency and high availability.
            - Azure DNS uses anycast networking, meaning any DNS query is answered by the closest available DNS server.

        Security
            - It's based on Azure Resource Manager. For example:
                - Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to control access
                - Activity logs to monitor modifications on resources or errors when troubleshooting
                - Resource locking to lock a subscription. It prevents other users to delete or modify critical resources

        Ease of use
            - Azure DNS can manage DNS records and provide it  for external resources.
            - Integrated in the Azure portal, sharing the same credentials, support contract, and billing

        Cutomizable virtual networks with private domains
            - It supports private DNS domains

        Alias records
            - Possibility to use an alias record set to refer to an Azure resource, such as an Azure public IP address, Azure Traffica Manager Profile,
            or Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) endpoint
            - The alias record set points to the service instance, and the service instance is associated with an IP address.

        MS Entra ID: Directory service that enables you to sign in and access both MS cloud apps and cloud apps

        Users that uses MS Entra ID:
            - IT Administrators
            - App developers
            - Users
            - Online service subscribers

        What does it do?
            - authentication
            - Single sign-on
            - Application management
            - Device management

        Connection between on-premises AD and MS Entra ID
            - Establish connection using MS Entra Connect, which synchronizes user identities between on-premises AD and
            MS Entra ID

        MS Entra Domain Services
            - Manage domain services such as domain join, group policy, lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP), 
            and Kerberos/NTLM authentication.
            - A managed domain is configured to perform a one-way synchronization

    Unit 3: Describe Azure authentication methods
         - Authentication is the process of establishing the identity of a person, service, or device.

         - Single sign-on (SSO) enables a user to sign in one time and use that credential to access multiple resources 
         and applications from different providers.

         - Multifactor authentication is the process of prompting a user for an extra form (or factor) of identification 
         during the sign-in process. MFA helps protect against a password compromise in situations where the password was 
         compromised but the second factor wasn't.

         - Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication is a Microsoft service that provides multifactor authentication capabilities.

         - Passwordless authentication methods removes and replaces the password with something you have, plus something you are, 
         or something you know. For example: PIN or Fingerprint from your personal computer. There are three options offered:
            - Windows Hello for Business: Ideal for information workers that have their own designated Windows PC.
            - Microsoft Authenticator App: The Authenticator App turns any iOS or Android phone into a strong, passwordless credential.
            - FIDO2 security keys: Are typically USB devices, but could also use Bluetooth or NFC

    Unit 4: Describe Azure external identities
        - Interactions with users outside the company. There are 3 options:
            - Business to business (B2B) collaboration: Let the users use their preferred identity to sign-in in MS apps
            - B2B direct connect: Establish a mutual, two-way trust with another MS Entra organization
            - MS Entra business to customer (B2C): Publish modern SaaS apps or custom-developed apps to consumers and customers

    Unit 5: Describe Azure conditional access
        - Conditional Access is a tool that Microsoft Entra ID uses to allow (or deny) access to resources based on identity signals.
        - Some cases to use it:
            - Require multifactor authentication (MFA) to access an app depending on the requester's role, location, or network.
            - Require access to services only through approved client applications.
            - Require users to access your app only from managed devices.
            - Block access from untrusted sources.

    Unit 6: Describe Azure role-based access control
        - Least privilege
        - Control accesses through Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC).
        - Scopes included:
            - A management group (a collection of multiple subscriptions)
            - A single subscription
            - A resource group
            - A single resource

    Unit 7: Describe zero trust model
        - Zero Trust is a security model that assumes the worst case scenario and protects resources with that expectation.
        It's based on the following guiding principles:
            - Verify explicitly: Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points.
            - Use least privilege access: Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access.
            - Assume breach: Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption. Use analytics to get visibility, 
            drive threat detection, and improve defenses.

    Unit 8: Describe defense-in-depth
        - Protect information and prevent it from being stolen

        Layers of defense-in-depth
            - The physical security layer: first line of defense to protect computing hardware in the datacenter.
            - The identity and access layer: controls access to infrastructure and change control.
            - The perimeter layer: uses distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection.
            - The network layer: limits communication between resources through segmentation and access controls.
            - The compute layer: secures access to virtual machines.
            - The application layer: helps ensure that applications are secure and free of security vulnerabilities.
            - The data layer: controls access to business and customer data that you need to protect.

1. Describe cost management in Azure
    Unit 1: Learning objectives
        After completing this module, you’ll be able to:

        - Describe factors that can affect costs in Azure.
        - Compare the Pricing calculator and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator.
        - Describe the Microsoft Cost Management Tool.
        - Describe the purpose of tags.

    Unit 2: Describe factors that can affect costs in Azure
        Capital Expense (CapEx): Building out and maintaining infrastructure
        Operational Expense (OpEx): Renting infrastructure (compute, storage, networking, and so on)
            OpEx cost can be impacted by many factors, like:
                - Resource type
                    A number of factors will influence the cost of Azure resources. The type of resources, the settings for the resource, and the Azure region are one of them.
                - Consumption
                    Pay-as-you-go: Use more compute, pay more and vice-versa.
                - Maintenance
                    Possibility to adjust resources based on demand. Use of resource groups can help to keep everything organized.
                - Geography
                    Azure is distributed globally, enabling you to deploy your services centrally or closest to your customers, or something in between.
                    The cost of the resources will vary depending on the location. Network traffic is also impacted.
                - Subscription type
                    Some subscription types include usage allowances, which affect costs.
                - Azure Marketplace
                    Allows us to purchase Azure-based solutions and services from third-party vendors. This could be a server with software preinstalled and configured,
                    or managed network firewall appliances, or connectors to third-party backup services.

    Unit 3: Compare the Pricing calculator and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator.
        There are two calculators:
            Pricing Calculator
                Designed to give you an estimated cost of provisioning resources in Azure.

            Total cost of ownership (TCO)
                Designed to help you compare the costs of running an on-premises infrastructure compared to an Azure Cloud infrastructure.

            The difference:
                Pricing calculator is used to build on an infrastructure on Azure while the TCO is used to present a comparison between your
                current on-prem infrastructure and an azure environment.

    Unit 4: Describe the Microsoft Cost Management tool
        It's the ability to quickly check Azure resource costs, create alerts based on resource spend, and create budgets that can
        be used to automate management of resources.

        Cost Analysis is a subset of Cost Management that provides a quick visual for your Azure costs.

        Cost alerts provide a single location to check on all of the different alert types, like:
            - Budget alerts
                Notifies you when spending, based on usage or cost, reaches or exceeds the amount defined in the alert condition.
                Created from the Azure portal or the Azure Consumption API
            - Credit alerts
                Notifies you when Azure credit monetary commitments are consumed.Monetary commitments are for organizations with Enterprise 
                Agreements (EAs)
            - Department spending quota alerts
                Notifies you when department spending reaches a fixe threshold of the quota. Spending quotas are configured in the EA portal.
    
        Budgets
            A budget is where you set a spending limit for Azure. You can set budgets based on a subscription, resource group, service type,
            or other criteria. When you set a budget, you will also set a budget alert.

    Unit 7: Describe the purpose of tags
        Tags provide extra information, or metadata, about your resources. This metadata is useful for:
            - Resource Management
            - Cost Management and Optimization
            - Operations Management
            - Security
            - Governance and regulatory compliance
            - Workload optimization and automation

    Unit 2: Describe tools for interacting with Azure

        - Azure portal: web-based
        - Azure PowerShell: shell to run commands called command-lets (cmdlets). These commands call the Azure REST 
        API to perform management tasks in Azure. 
        - Azure Command Line Interface (CLI): equivalent to Azure PowerShell, with the primary difference being the syntax of commands.

    Unit 3: Describe the purpose of Azure Arc

        Azure Arc provides a centralized, unified way to:
            - Manage your entire environment together by projecting your existing non-Azure resources into ARM.
            - Manage multi-cloud and hybrid virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, and databases as if they are running in Azure.
            - Use familiar Azure services and management capabilities, regardless of where they live.
            - Continue using traditional ITOps while introducing DevOps practices to support new cloud and native patterns in your environment.
            - Configure custom locations as an abstraction layer on top of Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters and cluster extensions.

        What can Azure Arc do outside of Azure?
            - Servers
            - Kubernetes clusters
            - Azure data services
            - SQL Server
            - Virtual machines (preview)

    Unit 4: Describe Azure Resource Manager and Azure ARM templates
        Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the deployment and management service for Azure

        Azure Resource Manager benefits
            - Manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts.
            - Deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group.
            - Re-deploy your solution throughout the development life-cycle.
            - Define the dependencies between resources.
            - Apply access control to all services.
            - Apply tags to resources.
            - Clarify your organization's billing.

        Benefits of using ARM templates
            - Declarative syntax
            - Repeatable results
            - Orchestration
            - Modular files
            - Extensibility

        Bicep benefits
            - Support for all resource types and API versions.
            - Simple syntax.
            - Repeatable results
            - Orchestration
            - Modularity


4. Describe monitoring tools in Azure
    Unit 1: Learning objectives
        After completing this module, you’ll be able to:

            - Describe the purpose of Azure Advisor.
            - Describe Azure Service Health.
            - Describe Azure Monitor, including Azure Log Analytics, Azure Monitor Alerts, and Application Insights.

    Unit 2: Describe the purpose of Azure Advisor
        Azure Advisor evaluates your Azure resources and makes recommendations to help improve reliability, security,
        and performance, achieve operational excellence, and reduce costs.

        The recommendations are divided into five categories:
            - Reliability
            - Security
            - Performance
            - Operational Excellence
            - Cost

    Unit 3: Describe Azure Service Health
        Azure Service Health helps you keep track of Azure resource, both your specifically deployed resources and the overall status of Azure.

        There are three different Azure services:
            - Azure Status: is a broad picture of the status of Azure globally
            - Service Health: provides a narrower view of Azure services and regions.
            - Resource Health: It provides information about the health of your individual cloud resources

    Unit 4: Describe Azure Monitor
        Azure Monitor is a platform for collecting data on your resources, analyzing that data, visualizing the information, and even acting on the results.

        Azure Log Analytics
            Azure Log Analytics is the tool in the Azure portal where you’ll write and run log queries on the data gathered by Azure Monitor.

        Azure Monitor Alerts
            Azure Monitor Alerts are an automated way to stay informed when Azure Monitor detects a threshold being crossed.

        Application Insights
            Application Insights, an Azure Monitor feature, monitors your web applications. Application Insights is capable of monitoring applications 
            that are running in Azure, on-premises, or in a different cloud environment.
