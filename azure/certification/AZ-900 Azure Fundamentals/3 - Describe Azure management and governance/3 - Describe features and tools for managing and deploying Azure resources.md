# Describe Features and Tools for Managing and Deploying Azure Resources

## [Unit 1: Introduction](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-features-tools-manage-deploy-azure-resources/1-introduction)
### Learning Objectives:
- Describe the Azure portal.
- Describe Azure Cloud Shell, including Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell.
- Describe the purpose of Azure Arc.
- Describe Azure Resource Manager (ARM), ARM templates, and Bicep.

## [Unit 2: Describe Tools for Interacting with Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-features-tools-manage-deploy-azure-resources/2-describe-interacting-azure)
- **Azure portal:** Web-based interface for managing Azure resources.
- **Azure PowerShell:** Shell for running commands (cmdlets) to manage Azure resources using Azure REST API.
- **Azure Command Line Interface (CLI):** Similar to Azure PowerShell but with different syntax for commands.

## [Unit 3: Describe the Purpose of Azure Arc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-features-tools-manage-deploy-azure-resources/3-describe-purpose-of-azure-arc)
- **Azure Arc:** Centralized, unified management for:
  - Projecting non-Azure resources into ARM.
  - Managing multi-cloud and hybrid resources like VMs, Kubernetes clusters, and databases.
  - Using Azure services and management capabilities outside Azure.
  - Supporting traditional ITOps and DevOps practices.
  - Configuring custom locations for Azure Arc-enabled resources.

## [Unit 4: Describe Azure Resource Manager and Azure ARM Templates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-features-tools-manage-deploy-azure-resources/4-describe-azure-resource-manager-azure-arm-templates)
- **Azure Resource Manager (ARM):** Deployment and management service for Azure.
  - Benefits: Declarative templates, group management, re-deployment, dependency management, access control, tagging, billing clarity.
- **ARM Templates Benefits:**
  - Declarative syntax.
  - Repeatable results.
  - Orchestration.
  - Modular files.
  - Extensibility.
- **Bicep Benefits:**
  - Support for all resource types and API versions.
  - Simple syntax.
  - Repeatable results.
  - Orchestration.
  - Modularity.
