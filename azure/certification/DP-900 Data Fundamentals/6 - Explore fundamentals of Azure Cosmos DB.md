Azure Cosmos DB is a foundational service in Azure, offering support for multiple application programming interfaces (APIs). It utilizes indexes and partitioning to provide fast read and write performance, scales massive volumes of data, and enables multi-region writes to become globally distributed.

### When to Use Azure Cosmos DB:
1. **IoT and Telematics**: Handling large amounts of data.
2. **Retail and Marketing**: Building a data catalog.
3. **Gaming**: Requires a database that is fast and can handle massive spikes in requests.
4. **Web and Mobile Applications**: Utilizing Cosmos DB SDKs for seamless integration.
