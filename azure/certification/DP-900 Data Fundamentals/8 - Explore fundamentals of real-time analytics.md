# Explore Fundamentals of Real-Time Analytics

## [Unit 1: Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-fundamentals-stream-processing/)

- Compare batch and stream processing
- Describe common elements of streaming data solutions
- Describe features and capabilities of Azure Stream Analytics
- Describe features and capabilities of Spark Structured Streaming on Azure
- Describe features and capabilities of real-time analytics in Microsoft Fabric

## [Unit 2: Understand Batch and Stream Processing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-fundamentals-stream-processing/2-batch-stream)

### Batch Processing
- Data is collected and processed together in a single operation
- Suitable for handling large datasets efficiently
- Time delay between ingesting and getting the results
- Used for complex analytics

### Stream Processing
- Data is constantly monitored and processed in real-time
- Suitable for time-critical operations
- Occurs in seconds or milliseconds
- Used for simple response functions, aggregates, or calculations

## [Unit 3: Explore Common Elements of Stream Processing Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-fundamentals-stream-processing/3-explore-common-elements)

- Event generation
- Data capture from streaming sources
- Processing by perpetual queries
- Writing processed data to outputs
- Real-time analytics services in Azure

## [Unit 4: Explore Azure Stream Analytics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-fundamentals-stream-processing/4-stream-analytics)

- Ingest data from various sources
- Process data using SQL-like queries
- Write results to different outputs
- Create Stream Analytics jobs or clusters for complex processing

## [Unit 6: Explore Apache Spark on Microsoft Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-fundamentals-stream-processing/6-spark-streaming)

- Use Spark in Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Databricks, or Azure HDInsight
- Spark Structured Streaming for real-time analytics
- Delta Lake for unified storage of streaming and batch data

## [Unit 8: Explore Real-Time Analytics in Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-fundamentals-stream-processing/8-fabric-realtime-analytics)

- Native support for real-time data analytics
- Eventstream for capturing real-time event data
- Persistence in a Lakehouse or KQL database
